# Configure Spring Boot to use a specific port for Redis during tests.
# The embedded Redis server (it.ozimov:embedded-redis) should be
# auto-configured by Spring Boot to run on this port.
spring:
  redis:
    port: 6370
    # Optional: If you want to ensure no external Redis is accidentally connected to,
    # you can set the host as well, though for embedded this is usually localhost.
    host: localhost
  # Disable external connections for other services if not needed for logging tests
  # For example, if Kafka is not needed for logging tests:
  # kafka:
  #   bootstrap-servers:
  # autoconfigure:
  #   exclude: org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.kafka.KafkaAutoConfiguration

# Ensure logs are written to console for easy debugging during tests
logging:
  level:
    com.finekuo: DEBUG
